Half a year has passed since I joined Okumura Lab, but still can't develop a focused research question. **A little of everything, nothing at all.** This repo is developed to help me dig more in the topic I'm interested with.

## Subword-aligned Cross-lingual Word Embeddings

### Cross-lingual Word Embeddings

* [A Survey of Cross-lingual Word Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04902.pdf)
* [Unsupervised Cross-lingual Word Embeddings Based on Subword Alignment](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/new/uploads/publication_file/file/911/cicling2019.pdf)

Unluckily, it seems the idea of using subword information in cross-lingual word embedding has already been published by [Jin SAKUMA](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~jsakuma/) of Yoshinaga Lab in U-Tokyo. **Need careful look to see what future work can be done while remain originality**.(2019/09/28)
